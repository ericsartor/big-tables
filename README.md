The goal of BigTables is to allow you to display large amounts of data in a tabular structure without slowing your page down, as well as giving you numerous tools to make that data easier to view manage.

Traditional HTML tables will make your pages hang when the row count gets into the thousands, and BigTables solves that by only ever rendering as many rows as it can fit in it's container.

BigTables also gives you lots of other features that are desireable when dealing with large amounts of data so you can write less code and simply feed your data into a pre-made table:

- custom scrolling with toggleable scroll bar
- vertical text hightling for copying lists of related data
- a search/filter API for enable users to find what they need
- sorting
- user-resizeable columns
- support for event handlers so your table can still react to the user however you want
- custom events such as scroll, draw, update, search, clearsearch and sort that you can attach listeners to to further ingrain your table into your webpage
- complete customizeability via CSS (just try not to break it ;D )
